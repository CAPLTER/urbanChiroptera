#### uploading sonobat data

The `sonobat_upload` function is used to upload sonobat output to the
urban_chiroptera database. The function takes three arguments: (1) the path and
name of the sonobat file to upload, (2) the sur name of the investigator who
processed the sonobat file (note that is not necessarily the person uploading
the data), and (3) the name of the study site. The name of the investigator and
the study site name are optional parameters with J. Dwyer represented as the
default investigator processing the data, and the study site name extracted from
the sonobat file name.

Upload a sonobat file with default arguments: J. Dwyer as the investigator who
identified the bats, and extracting the site name from the sonobat file name.

```{r upload sonobat, eval=FALSE}

sonobat_upload(sonobatFile = "~/Dropbox/development/urbanChiroptera/1-03_S1Winter_Output.csv")
```

Upload a sonobat file with the surveyor argument denoting that someone other
than J. Dwyer processed the data in the sonobat file. The site name is extracted
from the sonobat file name.

```{r upload sonobat data pass surveyor, eval=FALSE}

sonobat_upload(sonobatFile = "~/Dropbox/development/urbanChiroptera/1-03_S1Winter_Output.csv",
               surveyorSurname = "lewis")
```

Upload a sonobat file with the surveyor argument denoting that someone other
than J. Dwyer processed the data in the sonobat file, and explicitly identifying
the study site name.

```{r upload sonobat data pass surveyor site, eval=FALSE}

sonobat_upload(sonobatFile = "~/Dropbox/development/urbanChiroptera/1-03_S1Winter_Output.csv",
               surveyorSurname = "lewis",
               siteName = "1_01")
```
